    "## Exercise 1: classifying quasars and AGNs\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to classify galaxy vs quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For this purpose, we will be using a catalog magnitudes of galaxies and quasars as compiled by the SDSS. This catalog contains the following columns: `u, g, r, i, z, class, z1, zerr`. Then, you will explore this data set and use a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to find which colors yield the most efficient classification.  \n",

    "- Read the csv file `galaxyquasar.csv`. This file originally results from a SQL query implemented in the `fetch_sdss_galaxy_colors()` of the `astroML.datasets` (but this query occasionally fails).  \n",
    "- Create arrays for the (u-g), (g-r), (r-i), and (i-z) colors. Also create an array with the class labels where galaxy=0 and quasar=1.\n",
    "- Classify the data set against the target labels using a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. \n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to predict redshift of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey based only on the photometry. The data sample is now saved in the csv file `sdss_data_sub_v2.csv`. This data set is closer to what you would get in the real world that in exercise \\#1 (i.e. less cleaning). \n",
